# Financial Performance and Ratio Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Apple Inc.'s financial performance from 2012 to 2021. As an aspiring data analyst, I developed this visualization to demonstrate my ability to analyze complex financial data and derive meaningful insights for business decision-making.

Data Source: [Apple's Historical Financials](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/apple-s-historical-financials)

### Visualizations

1. **Total Assets and Liabilities Over Time (Line Chart)**
   - Tracks the trends of total assets and total liabilities from 2012 to 2020
   - Insight: Both assets and liabilities show an overall increasing trend, with assets consistently higher

2. **Total Assets, Total Liabilities and Total Equity Over Year (Bar Chart)**
   - Compares the three key balance sheet components annually
   - Insight: The gap between assets and liabilities (representing equity) has been relatively stable

3. **Cash & Equivalents, Accounts Receivable - Trade, Net and Total Inventory by Year (Stacked Bar Chart)**
   - Breaks down key components of current assets
   - Insight: Cash & equivalents have increased significantly from 2015 to 2020

4. **Accounts Payable, Notes Payable/ST Debt and LT Debt/Capital Leases by Year (Stacked Bar Chart)**
   - Analyzes the composition of liabilities over time
   - Insight: Long-term debt has increased substantially since 2012

## Business Impact and Insights

1. **Liquidity Position:**
   - The current ratio of 1.39 indicates that Apple can comfortably cover its short-term obligations.
   - The quick ratio of 0.56 suggests that while Apple's liquidity is decent, it may rely somewhat on inventory for short-term solvency.

2. **Leverage and Capital Structure:**
   - The debt to equity ratio of 2.39 indicates that Apple is using significant leverage, which could amplify returns but also increases financial risk.
   - The debt/assets ratio of 0.47 suggests that less than half of Apple's assets are financed through debt, which is a relatively conservative position.

3. **Asset Utilization:**
   - The consistent growth in total assets over time indicates continuous expansion and investment in the business.

4. **Working Capital Management:**
   - The increasing trend in cash & equivalents from 2015 to 2020 suggests improved cash management or potentially a build-up of cash for future investments or uncertain economic conditions.

5. **Long-term Financial Strategy:**
   - The significant increase in long-term debt since 2012 could indicate a strategic decision to take advantage of low interest rates for capital investments or shareholder returns.
